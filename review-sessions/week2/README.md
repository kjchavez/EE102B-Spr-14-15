# Review Session Week 2
The IPython notebook in this folder has an extended example of FIR filter design. We start with an RC low pass filter (i.e. an analog filter) and replace it with a FIR discrete-time filter.

- You can download the IPython notebook and run it locally.
- Or view a static version of the notebook at [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/kjchavez/EE102B-Spr-14-15/blob/master/review-sessions/week2/RC%20Low%20Pass%20Filter.ipynb)
